# ðŸš¨ Quick Fix: "column session_id does not exist" Error

## The Problem
You tried to run the new schema, but your `contact_inquiries` table already exists with the old structure.

---

## âœ… Solution (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run Migration Script
1. Open the file: `supabase-migration-contact-multistep.sql`
2. **Copy ALL contents** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. **Paste** into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

### Step 3: Verify Success
You should see a message like:
```
Success. 15 rows returned.
```

And a table showing:
- `total_records`: Number of existing submissions
- `completed_submissions`: Old submissions (marked as complete)
- `partial_submissions`: Should be 0

---

## âœ… What This Does

âœ… Adds `session_id` column (and all other new columns)
âœ… Keeps all your existing data safe
âœ… Marks old submissions as "completed" 
âœ… Creates indexes for faster queries
âœ… Sets up Row Level Security policies

## ðŸ§ª Test It

After running the migration:

1. Start your dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/contact`

3. Fill out the form step-by-step

4. Check your database - you should see the new submission with:
   - A unique `session_id`
   - `step_completed = 3`
   - All three timestamp fields filled

## ðŸ”„ If You Need to Switch Databases Later

The code is **database-agnostic**. See `DATABASE-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` for:
- How to export your data
- How to switch to any PostgreSQL database
- How to update the code (minimal changes needed)

## ðŸ†˜ Still Having Issues?

### Check 1: Does the table exist?
```sql
SELECT * FROM contact_inquiries LIMIT 1;
```
If this works, the table exists.

### Check 2: Did migration run successfully?
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'contact_inquiries' 
AND column_name = 'session_id';
```
Should return `session_id` if migration worked.

### Check 3: Are there any errors in the migration?
Re-run the migration script - it's safe to run multiple times!
All commands use `IF NOT EXISTS` so they won't cause errors.

**That's it! Your multi-step form should now work perfectly.** ðŸŽ‰
