# Work Content Implementation - Complete Guide

## 🎉 What's New

Your work/project pages now support **rich markdown content**, just like blogs! Each project can have:

- ✅ Individual detail pages (e.g., `/our-work/123`)
- ✅ Detailed content with markdown formatting
- ✅ Rich text editor in admin panel
- ✅ Image upload capability
- ✅ Professional case study presentation

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Update Database

Run ONE of these SQL scripts to add the `content` column:

**Option A: Simple Migration (No Sample Content)**
```bash
psql your_database < migration-add-work-content.sql
```

**Option B: Migration with Rich Sample Content (Recommended for Testing)**
```bash
psql your_database < migration-add-work-content-with-samples.sql
```

This will:
- Add the `content` column to the work table
- Populate existing projects with beautiful markdown sample content
- Show you what's possible with markdown formatting

### Step 2: Verify Database Update

Connect to your database and run:
```sql
SET search_path TO web, public;
SELECT id, title, 
       CASE 
         WHEN content IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has Content ✓'
         ELSE 'No Content'
       END as status
FROM work;
```

### Step 3: Test the Admin Panel

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/intellsys/our-work` (or your admin URL)
2. Click on any project to edit it
3. You'll see the new **"Project Details (Optional)"** section
4. The markdown editor is now available with formatting toolbar
5. Add or edit content using markdown syntax
6. Save your changes

### Step 4: Test Public Pages

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/our-work`
2. Click on any project card
3. You'll be taken to the individual project page
4. See your markdown content beautifully rendered
